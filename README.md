# Background #

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data from the data obtained from above link that can be used for later analysis.

# Code Book #

Code Book that explains the components of tidy data set and the transformations performed on the original dataset. It can be accessed [from here](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md)

# Analysis Script (run_analysis.R) #
------------------------------------

Transformations performed on original data set are programmed in an R script (run_analysis.R)
